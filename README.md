# EPP-Exam
My code for CSU Fullerton EPP Exam Solutions - 2020

Part 1 is 3 problems
- prob1 was simply to add in missing code for function headers and fix the functions to pass all tests.
- prob2 was to implement the checkList() function in given linked list file (non-recursively) to return a boolean value for whether the list of elements contained either 57 or 1957.
- prob3 was to implement the function of prob2 but recursively and return boolean if 57 or 1957 was in the list.

Part 2 is given test data of some dog breeds and information, pick data structure and implementation of my choice to read in the files data and store it. Then implement given functions.
